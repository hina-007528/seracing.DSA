#<h1>🔍 Search Algorithms in DSA</h1><br>
This repository provides clean and efficient implementations of two fundamental search algorithms used in Data Structures and Algorithms:

<h1>1. 🔢 Linear Search</h1>
Linear Search is a straightforward algorithm that traverses the entire list to find the target element. It is suitable for unsorted or small datasets.

Time Complexity: O(n)

Best Use Case: Small or unsorted data where simplicity is preferred.

<h1>2. ⚡ Binary Search</h1>
Binary Search is a highly efficient algorithm that works on sorted arrays by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

Time Complexity: O(log n)

Best Use Case: Large, sorted datasets where performance is crucial.
